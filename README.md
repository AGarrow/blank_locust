locust
======

So far I have:

1.  added manage.py

2.  added requirements.txt

3.  changed import line in loadgeomapping.py
  from
    from ...models import DivisionGeometry, TemporalSet
  to
    locust.models import DivisionGeometry, TemporalSet

4. cloned [represent-boundaries](https://github.com/rhymeswithcycle/represent-boundaries), followed instructions, including adding line to url file.



when I get back I need to:

continue resolving errors. Once resolved, nail down order in which to proceed after cloning locust repo.
